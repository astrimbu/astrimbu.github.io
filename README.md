When I was a kid, I loved to open a blank file in Notepad, reciting:

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            My Website
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
            Hello world!
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Save the file as `index.html`, open it with Netscape / IE...  

See **"Hello world!"**  

My face every time: ðŸ¤¯  

Play with the css a bit. Rinse, and repeat.  

> ...  
> all that is to say...  
> I am really easily entertained...  

I like to think my designs have a minimalist charm.  
Seeing my changes appear in the browser still makes me smile.
