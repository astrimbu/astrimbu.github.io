When I was young 👶 I quite enjoyed tinkering with HTML.

8 year-old me's workflow:

- jot down memorized boilerplate HTML in Notepad... ✍️

- save the file, point to it in a browser, smile when "Hello world" appeared 😊

- add more HTML, add some CSS, save, refresh, repeat, smile more 😊

The joy I got from turning logical, structured instructions into objects on a webpage never left me, resulting in...


Present Day Me 🧔 who's earned a bachelor's in computer science 🎓, does full-stack web development 👨‍💻

But still enjoys tinkering with basic HTML/CSS 😊

(not in Notepad anymore, promise)
